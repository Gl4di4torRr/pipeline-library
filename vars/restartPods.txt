# restartPods

This function will restart the pods.

Sample usage:

To run against the local:
```
stage('Restart') {
      steps {
         script {
            restartPods(projectName: "myproject", targetApp: "mydeploymentconfig")
         }
      }
    }
```

Run against remote cluster:
```
stage {
    steps{
        restartPods(projectname: "myproject", targetApp: "mydeploymentconfig", clusterUrl: "https://master.example.com", clusterToken: "KUBERNETES TOKEN")
    }
}
```
